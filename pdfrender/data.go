That URL may contain sensitive information, such as password recovery toke ns or personal information, and it will be visible that other origin. For instance, if the user is at example.com/password_recovery? unique_token=14f748d89d and clicks a link to example-analytics.com, that origin will receive the complete password recovery UR L in the headers and might be able to set the users password. The same happens for requests made automatically by the applicati on, such as XHR ones.\nApplications should set a secure referrer policy that prevents sensitive data from being sent to third party sites."
